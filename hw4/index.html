    <p>
      Progressive Web Apps are web apps that behave more like native apps.
       There are many aspects to PWA including offline caching and push notifications to name a couple.
        Part of having a site that utilizes PWA is service workers which allow for offline caching.
        A service worker is a javascript file that is registered to the browser, in my case through my main.js file.
    PWAs fall within a range from 0 to 100 rating.
    To get a higher rating your app must be optimized to load quickly without clutter,
    and use a service worker for caching.
      </p>
  <p>
    The reasons to use PWA are many.
     Most users will abandon a site if it does not load immediately.
     PWAs make sites faster and caching the files allow for offline viewing.
     If you're using a framework, PWAs allow for the user to load the framework's data based on their previous viewing.
     So if they had been on a website previously that used bootstrap, PWAs allow for your site to take advantage of that by caching the data.
